### Jott
Jott is a web and mobile application to allow developers to get program advice and snippets from OpenAI's GPT. Code can be saved and indexed by project, allowing devs to work on the go and organize their snippets logically. Full transparency, this was my first major project and I have improved 10 fold since then (:
